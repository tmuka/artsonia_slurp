# artsonia_slurp
a quick bash script to download and archive art from the artsonia.com website the school uses for my children's art projects

## Usage
run the script passing the students artist id number as the only argument to download all the art into the current folder
eg run
`artsonia_slurp.sh 0000000`

find the "slideshow" url for the student artist id
eg for https://www.artsonia.com/artists/portfolio.asp?id=0000000&artid=1111111
the slideshow url is
https://www.artsonia.com/slideshow.asp?artist=0000000
and the artist id is 0000000
